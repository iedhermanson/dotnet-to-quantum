# Week 1 – Foundations & Mindset (no deadlines)

Checklist:
- [ ] Install Math.NET Numerics
- [ ] Create vectors and matrices in C#
- [ ] Implement vector addition and scalar multiplication
- [ ] Compute dot product (real and complex inner product)
- [ ] Watch Essence of Linear Algebra videos 1–3

Notes:
- Inner product for complex vectors uses conjugation: ⟨v|w⟩ = sum(conj(v_i) * w_i)
