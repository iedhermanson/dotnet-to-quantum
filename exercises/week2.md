# Week 2 – Quantum State Representation

## Goal

Understand how qubits are represented mathematically.

## Concepts

- Column vectors for states (e.g., |0⟩, |1⟩)
- Complex amplitudes and normalization
- Inner products and probability interpretation
- Born rule: probability = |amplitude|²

## Practice in .NET

1. Represent |0⟩ and |1⟩ as vectors
2. Write a function to check if a vector is normalized
3. Create superposition states and verify normalization
4. Calculate measurement probabilities
