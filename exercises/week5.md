# Week 5 – Measurement & Eigen Concepts

## Goal

Understand measurement mathematically through eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

## Concepts

- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Quantum measurement as eigenvalue problem
- Measurement operators (observables)
- Projection operators: |ψ⟩⟨ψ|
- Born rule: P(outcome i) = |⟨i|ψ⟩|²
- Measurement in different bases (Z-basis, X-basis)
- Pauli-Z eigenstates: |0⟩ (eigenvalue +1), |1⟩ (eigenvalue -1)

## Practice in .NET

1. Write a function to simulate measurement probabilities
2. Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Pauli-Z
3. Calculate probabilities for measuring superposition states
4. Implement Born rule calculations
